Jason Doan's Personal Website

Hello, my name is Jason Doan. I am a junior studying computer science at the Univeristy of California, Davis.

I have created my own personal website. I hope that you will check it out to get a better idea of who Jason Doan is. I have listed a personal introduction, my achievements, and most importantly, the positives that I can bring into your company.

I have dedicated the past couple of months to studying HTML and CSS and decided to test my skills my building my own personal website.
